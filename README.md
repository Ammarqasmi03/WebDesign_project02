Developed a collection of front-end web components using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, focusing on clean UI design, responsiveness, and client-side functionality. Built a functional calculator with real-time operations, an image slider with smooth navigation controls, and a modern analog clock with dynamic hand movement based on system time. Created an Amazon-inspired landing page featuring a responsive navbar, search interface, product sections, and footer layout. Implemented a Bootstrap-based form validation system with secure input handling, error messaging, and user-friendly feedback. These projects demonstrate strong fundamentals in DOM manipulation, event handling, UI/UX design, and responsive web development.
